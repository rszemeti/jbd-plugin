## A SignalK plugin for use with JBD stlye battery management systems

Configuration requires only the name assigned to the battery (done via the standard phone app over BLE) 

The plugin can handle multiple batteries, allocating them to different busses on the vessel.

The backend requires the Python "bleak" package, installed with the command "pip install bleak"
